# Churn-Prediction-Analytics-Project
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various data analytics techniques. We utilized RStudio extensively for data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling. Our objective was to consolidate our findings and enhance the decision-making process regarding customer retention strategies.

## Project Overview
Churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses, particularly in industries where retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, we explored a dataset to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn and built predictive models to forecast churn likelihood.

## Predictive Modelling
To predict churn, we generated Association Rules and built several machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression
- CART (Classification and Regression Trees)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
  
Among these models, XGBoost stood out, achieving the highest overall mean accuracy and F1-Score, making it the most effective model for our churn prediction task.

##   Tools Used
RStudio: Data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, CART, Random Forest, XGBoost.

## Recommendations
Based on our analysis and secondary research, we derived several actionable recommendations to address the churn issue:

- Enhance Engagement with Non-Seniors: Focus on tailored engagement strategies for non-senior customers to further boost retention.
- Review Monthly Contracts & Internet Services: Consider revising the monthly contract terms or offering incentives to customers with fiber optic internet to reduce churn.
- Loyalty Programs: Strengthen loyalty programs targeting long-term customers to keep them engaged and satisfied.
- Optimize Payment Methods: Provide alternatives to electronic checks and ensure tech support is readily available to improve customer satisfaction.

Conclusion
This project has provided a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing customer churn and equipped us with predictive tools to mitigate this issue. The insights and models developed will serve as a foundation for implementing effective retention strategies.
